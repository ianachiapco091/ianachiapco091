- 👋 Hi, I’m @ianachiapco091
- 👀 I’m interested in STEM Related Topics like Coding, Programming(Python, R), Statistics, and Software Development...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python Programming via Internet...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on College Students, Professors, and even people who can guide me...
- 📫 How to reach me as a Computer Science Student (still deciding about my dream job), even I am looking forward to have a CS degree, I would like to become a statistician (or even programmer) even I have that degree. I am doing all my best for my dream career. I'm literally learning from the internet (like Youtube, Coursera) as I'm not relying on what my current professors in the major subjects said as I am looking for my own way to learn and develop...
