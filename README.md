- 👋 Hi, I’m @ianachiapco091
- 👀 I’m interested in STEM Related Topics like Coding, Programming(Python, C), Statistics, and Software Development...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python Programming via Internet...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on College Students, Professors, and even people who can guide me...
- 📫 How to reach me as a Computer Science Student (still deciding about my dream job), even I am looking forward to have a CS degree, I would like to become a software engineer (or even software tester) even I have that degree. I am doing all my best for my dream career. I'm literally learning from the internet (like Youtube, Coursera) as I am looking for my own way to learn and develop not only my instructors in the university...
