- 👋 Hi, I’m @ianachiapco091
- 👀 I’m interested in STEM Related Topics like Coding, Programming Language/s (Python, R), Statistics, Data Science, Software Testing and other topics related to STEM...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python Programming via Off Campus Learning sites, C# via On Campus for the subject (Computer Programming 1 or Fundamentals of Programming)...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on College Students and Professors who are open that based on my interests...
- 📫 How to reach me as a Computer Science Student, even I am looking forward to have a CS degree, I would like to become a statistician even I have that degree. I am doing all my best for my dream career. I'm literally learning from the internet (like Youtube, Coursera) as I'm not relying on what my current professors in the major subjects said as I am looking for my own way to learn and develop...
